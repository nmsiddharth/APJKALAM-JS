        <p>Javascript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.</p>

    <pre>
        1. Arithematic operators => Addition  +, Subtraction -, Multiplication *, Division /, Modulus %, Increment ++, Decrement --

        2. Comparison (Relational) Operators => Is equal to ==, Identical (equal and of same data type) ===, Not equal to !=, Not identical !==, Greater than >, Greater than <, Greater than <, Greater equal to >=, Less than <, Less than or equal to  <=

        3. Bitwise Operators => Bitwise AND &, Bitwise OR | , Bitwise XOR ^, Bitwise NOT ~, Bitwise Left Shift <<, Bitwise Right Shift >>, Bitwise Right Shift with Zero >>>

        4. Logical Operators => Logical AND &&, Logical OR ||, Logical NOT !
        
        5. Assignment Operators => Assign =, add and Assign +=, subtract and Assign -=, Multiply and assign *=, Divide and Assign /=, Modulus and Assign %=

        6. Special or Ternary operators => Condition ? "true" : "false";
