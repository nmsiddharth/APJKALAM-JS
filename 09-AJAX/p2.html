        <h3>What is Promise?</h3>
        <p>Promise is built-in constructor of javascript.</p>
        <p>A Promise object represents an operation which has produced or will eventually produce a value.Promises povide a robust way to wrap the (possibly pending) result of asynchronous request.</p>

        <h3>States of Promises</h3>
        <h5>1. Pending</h5>
        <p>The underlying operation has not yet completed or neither rejected.</p>

        <h5>2. Fulfilled</h5>
        <p>The operation has finished and promise is fulfilled with a response. (.then()) is used to handle fulfilled response. </p>

        <h5>3. Rejected</h5>
        <p>The error occured during the operation is rejected with a reason. (.catch()) is used to catch the error.</p>

        <h5>4. Settled</h5>
        <p>A promise is said to settled, (either resolved or rejected). Once the promise is settled , it becomes immutable.</p>

        <script>
            // let x = 99;
            let x = 999;

            const myResponse = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
                if(x<100){
                    resolve("HI");
                }else{
                    reject('OOPS');
                }
            });

            myResponse.then(function(value){
                // fulfilled response
                alert(value);
            }).catch(function(error){
                // rejected reason
                alert(error);
            });
        </script>
